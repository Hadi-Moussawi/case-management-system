# Product Requirements Document: Law Case Management SaaS Application

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a Software as a Service (SaaS) application designed to assist lawyers in managing their law cases.  The application will provide a centralized platform for managing various aspects of legal cases, focusing solely on the core functionality of case management.  No other features beyond this core functionality are included in this PRD.

**2. Product Specifications**

The application shall provide the following core functionalities:

* **Case Creation and Management:**  Users should be able to create new cases, input relevant case details (e.g., case name, client information, court information, case type, assigned attorney), and update these details throughout the case lifecycle.  This includes the ability to add, edit, and delete cases.
* **Document Management:**  The system will allow users to upload, store, organize, and retrieve case-related documents (e.g., pleadings, motions, discovery documents).  Document version control is required.  Users should be able to easily search and filter documents within a case.
* **Calendar and Scheduling:** The application will include a calendar functionality for scheduling court hearings, meetings with clients, and internal deadlines related to a specific case.  Users should be able to set reminders and receive notifications.
* **Client Management:** The system needs to allow for the input and management of client information relevant to each case (e.g., contact details, relevant communication history). This should be linked to specific cases.
* **Basic Reporting:** The application should provide basic reporting capabilities, such as a list of all active cases, cases by client, or cases by attorney.  These reports should be exportable (e.g., CSV, PDF).

**3. User Experience**

The application should provide a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.  Key aspects of the user experience include:

* **Intuitive Navigation:**  Users should easily navigate between different sections of the application, specifically between cases, documents, calendars, and client information.  A clear and consistent menu structure is required.
* **Search Functionality:** Robust search capabilities are needed to quickly locate specific cases, documents, or clients.  Search should be available across all relevant data fields.
* **Data Entry Forms:**  All data entry forms should be clear, concise, and easy to use, minimizing the number of fields required and ensuring data integrity.
* **Notification System:** The application should have a reliable notification system to alert users of upcoming deadlines and other important events, delivered via email and/or in-app notifications.

**4. Implementation Requirements**

This section outlines high-level technical requirements.  Detailed specifications will be provided in subsequent documentation.

* **Scalability:** The application should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users and cases.
* **Security:** The application must adhere to relevant security standards and best practices to protect sensitive client and case data.  This includes data encryption both in transit and at rest, secure authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
* **Integration:** The application should be designed with future integrations in mind, though specific integrations are not part of this initial release.
* **Technology Stack:**  The choice of specific technologies (programming languages, databases, cloud infrastructure) will be determined in a separate technical design document, but the application must be cloud-based for SaaS delivery.
* **API:**  A well-documented API should be considered for potential future integrations.


This PRD focuses solely on the core case management features. Further functionalities can be considered in future releases based on user feedback and market analysis.
